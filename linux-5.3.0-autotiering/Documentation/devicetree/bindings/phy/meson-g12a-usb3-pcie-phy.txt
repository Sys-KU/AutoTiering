* Amlogic G12A USB3 + PCIE Combo PHY binding

Required properties:
- compatible:	Should be "amlogic,meson-g12a-usb3-pcie-phy"
- #phys-cells:	must be 1. The cell number is used to select the phy mode
  as defined in <dt-bindings/phy/phy.h> between PHY_TYPE_USB3 and PHY_TYPE_PCIE
- reg:		The base address and length of the registers
- clocks:	a phandle to the 100MHz reference clock of this PHY
- clock-names:	must be "ref_clk"
- resets:	phandle to the reset lines for the PHY control
- reset-names:	must be "phy"

Example:
	usb3_pcie_phy: phy@46000 {
		compatible = "amlogic,g12a-usb3-pcie-phy";
		reg = <0x0 0x46000 0x0 0x2000>;
		clocks = <&clkc CLKID_PCIE_PLL>;
		clock-names = "ref_clk";
		resets = <&reset RESET_PCIE_PHY>;
		reset-names = "phy";
		#phy-cells = <1>;
	};
