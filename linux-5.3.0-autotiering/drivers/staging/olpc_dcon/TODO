TODO:
	- complete rewrite:
	  1. The underlying fbdev drivers need to be converted into drm kernel
	     modesetting drivers.
	  2. The dcon low-power display mode can then be integrated using the
	     drm damage tracking and self-refresh helpers.
	  This bolted-on self-refresh support that digs around in fbdev
	  internals, but isn't properly integrated, is not the correct solution.
	- see if vx855 gpio API can be made similar enough to cs5535 so we can
	  share more code
	- convert all uses of the old GPIO API from <linux/gpio.h> to the
	  GPIO descriptor API in <linux/gpio/consumer.h> and look up GPIO
	  lines from device tree, ACPI or board files, board files should
	  use <linux/gpio/machine.h>
	- allow simultaneous XO-1 and XO-1.5 support
